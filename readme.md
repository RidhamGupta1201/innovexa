## 🧩 Problem Statement – Open Innovation

In modern educational institutions, students often struggle to find the *right peers* to collaborate with based on complementary skills, shared interests, or project goals.  
Despite having diverse talent pools, there is no intelligent, centralized platform that helps students discover **like‑minded peers**, collaborate efficiently, and grow together.

This problem falls under **Open Innovation**, where technology is used to break silos, foster collaboration, and enable smarter connections within communities.  
CampusConnect aims to solve this by leveraging AI and modern web technologies to create an intelligent peer‑matching ecosystem for campuses.
Not only restricted to this, our website also gives the users the information about the events, hackathons and various other programs ongoing or upcoming in their as well as other colleges of the globe. 
A smart and innovative Complaint algorithm is also instilled in the project which will be of much help.
