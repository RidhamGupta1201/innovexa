  <h2>What We Do</h2>

  <p class="highlight-text">
    Campus Connect is built to solve one core problem — <strong>talent exists, but connection doesn’t.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    On every campus, students struggle silently with academics, projects, career paths, and personal growth —
    while someone nearby already has the skill they need.
    Campus Connect bridges this gap.
